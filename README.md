# ava-few

This is the frontend application for the `ava` project — a capstone project developed as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Universitatea „Tibiscus” - Timișoara.

Built using **React.js** (with the MERN stack), this web app allows researchers to visualize and interact with medical sensor data from diabetic patients. It features dynamic charts rendered with **Plotly.js**, user-driven filtering, and tools for anomaly detection and patch analysis.

The frontend communicates with the `ava-be` backend API and supports modern development practices including component-based architecture, React hooks, and responsive design.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Ensure `.env` File Exists

Check that the `.env` file is in the project directory. If it's missing, create it manually and add the required environment variables:

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<the_base_BE_URL_you_use_in_the_API_calls_routes>
